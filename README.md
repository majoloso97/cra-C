# cra-C (read Crazy)

This repo started as a list of random projects from HelloWorld to who knows what, as part of my learning process of the C programming language. Being curious about low level details of things, I started learning the basics of C by doing.

Now, that I'm going through the [CS50â€™s Introduction to Computer Science](https://pll.harvard.edu/course/cs50-introduction-computer-science), this repo is repurposed to contain my solution to CS50's problemsets (subdirectoires in patters like: /CS50/PSx), as well as any other project I decide do build on my own while taking the course.


## CS50's Problem Sets completed so far:
