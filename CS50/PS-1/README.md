# Problem Set 1

Each directory here corresponds to the [assignments of the Problem Set 1](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2024/psets/1/) requested in the [Week 1 of CS50](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2024/weeks/1/). The solutions here are based just on the techinques taught during the current week of study, so I avoided using concepts I'm aware of but hasn't been taught in the course so far. I'm aware some of the solutions could be simpler/more efficient, but I forced myself to develop them based on the initial concepts discussed on the week's content.
